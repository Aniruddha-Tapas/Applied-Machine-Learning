    "Here we will look at affinity analysis that determines when objects occur\n",
    "frequently together. This is also called market basket analysis, after one of\n",
    "the use cases of determining when items are purchased together frequently.\n",
    "In this example, we wish to work out when\n",
    "two movies are recommended by the same reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affinity analysis\n",
    "Affinity analysis is the task of determining when objects are used in similar\n",
    "ways. The data for affinity analysis is often described in the form of a\n",
    "transaction. Intuitively, this comes from a transaction at a storeâ€”determining\n",
    "when objects are purchased together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic algorithm for affinity analysis is called the Apriori algorithm. It addresses\n",
    "the exponential problem of creating sets of items that occur frequently within a\n",
    "database, called frequent itemsets. Once these frequent itemsets are discovered,\n",
    "creating association rules is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apriori algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we ensure that a rule\n",
    "has sufficient support within the dataset. Defining a minimum support level is the\n",
    "key parameter for Apriori. To build a frequent itemset, for an itemset (A, B) to have a\n",
    "support of at least 30, both A and B must occur at least 30 times in the database. This\n",
    "property extends to larger sets as well. For an itemset (A, B, C, D) to be considered\n",
    "frequent, the set (A, B, C) must also be frequent (as must D).\n",
    "These frequent itemsets can be built up and possible itemsets that are not frequent\n",
    "(of which there are many) will never be tested. This saves significant time in testing\n",
    "new rules.\n",
    "Other example algorithms for affinity analysis include the Eclat and FP-growth\n",
    "algorithms. There are many improvements to these algorithms in the data mining\n",
    "literature that further improve the efficiency of the method. In this chapter, we will\n",
    "focus on the basic Apriori algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform association rule mining for affinity analysis, we first use the Apriori\n",
    "to generate frequent itemsets. Next, we create association rules (for example, if a\n",
    "person recommended movie X, they would also recommend movie Y) by testing\n",
    "combinations of premises and conclusions within those frequent itemsets.\n",
    "For the first stage, the Apriori algorithm needs a value for the minimum support\n",
    "that an itemset needs to be considered frequent. Any itemsets with less support will\n",
    "not be considered. Setting this minimum support too low will cause Apriori to test a\n",
    "larger number of itemsets, slowing the algorithm down. Setting it too high will result\n",
    "in fewer itemsets being considered frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second stage, after the frequent itemsets have been discovered, association\n",
    "rules are tested based on their confidence. We could choose a minimum confidence\n",
    "level, a number of rules to return, or simply return all of them and let the user decide\n",
    "what to do with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will return only rules above a given confidence level. Therefore,\n",
    "we need to set our minimum confidence level. Setting this too low will result in rules\n",
    "that have a high support, but are not very accurate. Setting this higher will result in\n",
    "only more accurate rules being returned, but with fewer rules being discovered."

    "### The movie recommendation problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Product recommendation is big business. Online stores use it to up-sell to\n",
    "customers by recommending other products that they could buy. Making better\n",
    "recommendations leads to better sales. When online shopping is selling to millions\n",
    "of customers every year, there is a lot of potential money to be made by selling more\n",
    "items to these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product recommendations have been researched for many years; however, the field\n",
    "gained a significant boost when Netflix ran their Netflix Prize between 2007 and\n",
    "2009. This competition aimed to determine if anyone can predict a user's rating of a\n",
    "film better than Netflix was currently doing. The prize went to a team that was just\n",
    "over 10 percent better than the current solution. While this may not seem like a large\n",
    "improvement, such an improvement would net millions to Netflix in revenue from\n",
    "better movie recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the inception of the Netflix Prize, Grouplens, a research group at the University\n",
    "of Minnesota, has released several datasets that are often used for testing algorithms\n",
    "in this area. They have released several versions of a movie rating dataset, which\n",
    "have different sizes. There is a version with 100,000 reviews, one with 1 million\n",
    "reviews and one with 10 million reviews.\n",
    "The datasets are available from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/\n",
    "and the dataset we are going to use in this chapter is the MovieLens 1 million\n",
    "dataset. Download this dataset and unzip it in your data folder. We then load the dataset using Pandas. The MovieLens dataset is in a good shape; however, there are some changes from the\n",
    "default options in pandas.read_csv that we need to make. To start with, the data is\n",
    "separated by tabs, not commas. Next, there is no heading line. This means the first\n",
    "line in the file is actually data and we need to manually set the column names. When loading the file, we set the delimiter parameter to the tab character, tell pandas\n",
    "not to read the first row as the header (with header=None), and set the column\n",
    "names."
