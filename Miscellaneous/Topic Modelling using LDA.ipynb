LDA is based on probabilistic graphical modeling while NMF relies on linear algebra. Both algorithms take as input a bag of words matrix (i.e., each document represented as a row, with each columns containing the count of words in the corpus). The aim of each algorithm is then to produce 2 smaller matrices; a document to topic matrix and a word to topic matrix that when multiplied together reproduce the bag of words matrix with the lowest error."
